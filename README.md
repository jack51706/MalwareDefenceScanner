# MalwareDefenceScanner

*This project is a fork of Autostart Locations Malware Scanner - a programming exercise.*

Malware Defence Scanner is a C# console program aimed at learning incident response and malware reversing techniques. A proof of concept showing that you can easily write your own security tools and understand how malware works by writing code.
It is at the beginning of its development process.

Currently it can perform a search in:
- filesystem autostart locations
- selected registry hives
- scheduled tasks
- user profile for MS Excel and Word macros
